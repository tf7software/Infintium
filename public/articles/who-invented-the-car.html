      <p>It's tricky to pinpoint one inventor for the car as it was a product of many innovations and contributions over time. However, <strong>Karl Benz</strong> is widely credited as the <strong>inventor of the first gasoline-powered automobile</strong> in 1886.</p>
<p>He built the <strong>Benz Patent Motorwagen</strong>, which is considered the first true automobile. However, other inventors like <strong>Gottlieb Daimler</strong> were also working on similar vehicles at the same time.</p>
<p>Here's a quick timeline of key contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1769:</strong> Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first self-propelled steam-powered vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>1801:</strong> Richard Trevithick invented the first steam-powered road locomotive.</li>
<li><strong>1860s:</strong> Ã‰tienne Lenoir created the first internal combustion engine, although it was inefficient.</li>
<li><strong>1886:</strong> Karl Benz patented his gasoline-powered three-wheeled automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen.</li>
<li><strong>1887:</strong> Gottlieb Daimler invented a high-speed internal combustion engine.</li>
<li><strong>1896:</strong> Henri Ford built his first car, the Quadricycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while Karl Benz gets the most credit, it's important to remember that many inventors contributed to the development of the modern car.</p>
