      <p>Grass is green because of a pigment called <strong>chlorophyll</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chlorophyll</strong> absorbs sunlight, primarily in the red and blue wavelengths.</li>
<li><strong>Green light</strong> is reflected back, which is why we see grass as green.</li>
<li>This process of absorbing sunlight is essential for <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, where plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in short, grass is green because of its ability to absorb most wavelengths of light except for green, which it reflects back to our eyes.</p>
