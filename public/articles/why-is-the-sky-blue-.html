  <title>Why is the sky blue?</title>

      <p>The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called <strong>Rayleigh scattering</strong>. Here's a simplified explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sunlight is made up of all colors.</strong>  The colors we see in a rainbow are actually the different wavelengths of light that make up white sunlight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Air molecules scatter sunlight.</strong>  When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny particles of air, mainly nitrogen and oxygen molecules. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blue light scatters more.</strong>  Because these air molecules are so small, they scatter shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) much more effectively than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We see scattered blue light.</strong>  As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the blue light gets scattered in all directions. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's a helpful analogy:</strong> Imagine a room with a lot of dust particles.  If you shine a white light into the room, the dust particles will scatter the light, making the room appear slightly blue.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the sky not violet if violet light scatters even more than blue?</strong></p>
<p>While violet light does scatter even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. This means we perceive more of the scattered blue light than the scattered violet light, making the sky appear blue.</p>
<p><strong>The color of the sky can change depending on the time of day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunrise and sunset:</strong>  When the sun is low on the horizon, sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere.  This means more of the blue light is scattered away, leaving more of the longer wavelengths (red and orange) to reach our eyes. This is why the sky appears red, orange, and yellow at sunset and sunrise.</li>
</ul>
