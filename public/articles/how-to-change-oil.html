      <h2>How to Change Your Car's Oil: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
<p><strong>Before you start:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gather your materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New engine oil (check your owner's manual for the correct type and amount)</li>
<li>Oil filter (also check your manual for the correct type)</li>
<li>Oil drain pan</li>
<li>Wrench or socket for your drain plug</li>
<li>Oil filter wrench (if needed)</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
<li>Rags</li>
<li>Funnel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety first:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Park your car on a level surface.</li>
<li>Engage the parking brake and block the wheels.</li>
<li>Wear safety glasses and gloves.</li>
<li>Make sure the engine is cool before starting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the oil drain plug:</strong> Look for a bolt on the underside of your engine, usually near the front.</li>
<li><strong>Place the drain pan underneath the drain plug.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Loosen the drain plug.</strong> Use a wrench or socket that fits the plug. Do not remove the plug completely yet.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the drain plug.</strong> Let the oil drain completely into the pan. This may take a few minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Replace the drain plug.</strong> Tighten it securely, but do not overtighten.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the old oil filter:</strong> Locate the oil filter, usually near the top of the engine. It's typically a cylindrical metal container.</li>
<li><strong>Use an oil filter wrench to loosen the filter.</strong> Turn it counterclockwise until it comes off.</li>
<li><strong>Apply a thin coat of oil to the new filter's gasket.</strong> This will help prevent the filter from sticking.</li>
<li><strong>Screw on the new oil filter.</strong> Hand-tighten it until it's snug. Do not overtighten.</li>
<li><strong>Pour the new oil into the engine.</strong> Use the funnel to pour the correct amount of oil into the engine's oil filler neck.</li>
<li><strong>Check the oil level.</strong> Use the dipstick to check the oil level. Add more oil if needed, but do not overfill.</li>
<li><strong>Start the engine and check for leaks.</strong> Run the engine for a few minutes to let the oil circulate. Check underneath for any leaks.</li>
<li><strong>Dispose of the old oil properly.</strong> Take it to a recycling center or dispose of it according to your local regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm up your engine before draining the oil.</strong> This will make the oil flow more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a record of your oil changes.</strong> This will help you remember when to change the oil again.</li>
<li><strong>Use the correct type of oil.</strong> Check your owner's manual for the recommended type and viscosity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a general guide. Always consult your owner's manual for specific instructions and warnings for your particular car model. If you are unsure about any step, it is best to consult a professional mechanic.</p>
