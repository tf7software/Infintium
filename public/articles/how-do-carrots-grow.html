      <p>Carrots grow from <strong>seeds</strong> and their journey from tiny seed to delicious orange root is pretty fascinating! Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
<p><strong>1. Planting the Seed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carrot seeds are quite small, so they need to be planted about <strong>1/4 inch deep</strong> in the soil.</li>
<li>The soil should be <strong>moist and well-drained</strong>.</li>
<li>It's best to plant them in <strong>rows</strong>, spaced about <strong>6 inches apart</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Germination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After about <strong>2 weeks</strong>, the seeds will sprout, sending up <strong>tiny green shoots</strong>.</li>
<li>These shoots are actually the <strong>carrots' leaves</strong>, called <strong>foliage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Growth and Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the seedlings grow, they develop a <strong>tap root</strong> that grows deep into the soil. This is the part we eat!</li>
<li>The tap root will gradually become <strong>thicker and longer</strong> as it absorbs nutrients and water from the soil.</li>
<li>The carrot's foliage will continue to grow, providing energy for the root to develop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Harvesting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the variety, carrots are typically ready to harvest in <strong>60-90 days</strong>.</li>
<li>You can tell a carrot is ready when the <strong>shoulders</strong> (the top part of the root) are about <strong>1 inch in diameter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gently pull</strong> the carrots from the soil, being careful not to damage the roots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some additional details about carrot growth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Carrots need <strong>full sun</strong>, which means at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
<li><strong>Soil:</strong> Carrots prefer loose, well-drained soil with a <strong>neutral pH</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Watering:</strong> Carrots need consistent moisture, especially during the first few weeks after planting.</li>
<li><strong>Thinning:</strong> Once the seedlings are about 2 inches tall, you'll need to <strong>thin</strong> them out so they have enough space to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding how carrots grow, you can provide them with the right conditions to thrive and produce delicious, crunchy roots!</p>
