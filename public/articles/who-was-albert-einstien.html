      <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of his key contributions and life:</p>
<p><strong>Major Contributions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theory of Relativity:</strong> His most famous work, consisting of special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915). These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe.</li>
<li><strong>Photoelectric Effect:</strong> Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, where light can knock electrons off a metal surface, which led to the development of quantum theory.</li>
<li><strong>Brownian Motion:</strong> Einstein explained the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, providing evidence for the existence of atoms.</li>
<li><strong>E=mcÂ²:</strong>  He derived the famous equation that shows the relationship between mass and energy, which laid the foundation for nuclear physics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Born:</strong> March 14, 1879, Ulm, Germany.</li>
<li><strong>Early Life:</strong>  Einstein showed a strong interest in mathematics and physics from a young age.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> He studied physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich.</li>
<li><strong>Career:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland.</li>
<li>Became a professor at the University of Zurich and later at the University of Prague.</li>
<li>Joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1933.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Later Life:</strong> Einstein became a vocal advocate for peace and social justice.</li>
<li><strong>Death:</strong> April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legacy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein's work has had a profound impact on modern science and technology.</li>
<li>His theories have been used to develop technologies like GPS navigation, nuclear power, and medical imaging.</li>
<li>He is widely considered to be one of the most influential physicists of all time, a scientific icon, and a symbol of intellectual genius.</li>
</ul>
<p>Einstein's genius and his work continue to inspire generations of scientists and thinkers around the world.</p>
