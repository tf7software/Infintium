      <p>While the concept of toasting bread with heat goes back centuries, the invention of the <strong>electric toaster</strong> is credited to <strong>Albert Marsh</strong> in <strong>1905</strong>.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Marsh's design wasn't the first electric toaster. Several others had attempted to create an electric bread toasting device before him.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of the key players:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1893:</strong>  Alan MacMasters of Scotland patented the first electric toaster. However, his design was impractical and never went into production.</li>
<li><strong>1905:</strong> Albert Marsh filed a patent for an electric toaster with a heating element and a device to automatically flip the bread. His design was more practical but still had limitations.</li>
<li><strong>1909:</strong>  The first commercially successful electric toaster was created by General Electric (GE) under the leadership of Earl Richardson. This model used nichrome wire as the heating element and had a more efficient design.</li>
<li><strong>1919:</strong>  The first pop-up toaster was invented by the company Toastmaster. This innovation made toasting bread much easier and more convenient.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while Albert Marsh is often credited with the invention of the electric toaster, it was a gradual process with several inventors contributing to its development.</p>
